<p class="meta">11 Jan 2019 - Chicago</p>

a new american boy band. the best places to eat in the area. a house belonging to a nuclear family in the fifties. a dog wearing human clothes.

a stern father. an inescapable feeling of dread. an inescapable feeling of shame. 

a piano. a piano that's too loud, and it's early in the morning. don't wake anyone up.

abandoned.
