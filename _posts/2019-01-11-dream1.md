<p class="meta">11 Jan 2019 - Chicago</p>

a boy band. the best restaurants in town. the house of a nuclear family in the fifties. a dog wearing human clothes.

a stern father. an inescapable feeling of dread. an inescapable feeling of shame. 

a piano. a piano that's too loud, and it's early in the morning. don't wake anyone up.

abandoned.
