title: Gone with the Wind

I'm going to watch Gone with the Wind (1939). Since its runtime is nearly four hours, I figured I would take a few notes while I watched it, to see if that's something that helps me in some way. Movies are long, and it's easy to forget the finer details when thinking about them in post.

***

It begins with an overture. Not entirely sure what the original context of having an overture was for (I think maybe it was intended to set the tone for the film while people were filing into the theatre, preparing to watch the film, in the time before previews for other films became common practice). I like the idea that movies have basically always been introduced by some tone-setting device which prepares the viewer emotionally for the films themes. The music here is grand, sweeping, and orchestral, overlaid with images of the Old South.

This is definitely a love story.

Gone with the Wind features a really dishonest depiction of the Old South. It's quite whitewashed, it seems. It's one thing to tell a story through the white lens here, that's fine if it's the story it needs to tell, but it seems to think that black slaves were in some way happy with their position in this society. The black characters in the film feel like sidepieces, relegated to the position of servants, with no capacity for nuanced characterization. This film's a bit racist. Does that make it unworthy of examination? I don't think so, but I think it also makes it unworthy of its classic status. Sometimes I think about how so much of "classic" art history is really just what white people decided it to be. It's what those in power deemed safe enough to teach in schools and point at and say "look at this trophy of our culture, isn't it just wonderful?" Gone with the Wind is, technically speaking, a marvel. The set design, cinematography, and score are grandiose and pristine in every way serving its goals of romanticizing the Old South. However, I would agree with Pauline Kael in saying that technical prowess does not indicate artistic value. It only assumes artistic value in a manner that's a bit didactic. Its important, then, to consider instead the weight of the baggage a film like this carries. That, to me, is more meaningful than its story beats or moments of beauty, because it considers a context larger than the film itself.

I suppose this kind of isn't a love story. I mean, it has love as a major theme, but I see this more as being about what happens to love in a time of war. I like also how the film chooses to tackle the gradual decline of the South during the war. As the war effort becomes more desparate, it tangles and ensnares Scarlett in a double-helix of love and anger.

And then Sherman marches to the sea.

I'm watching this movie on Netflix, who has so graciously allowed me the opportunity to watch a classic through legal means. I've been pretty concerned lately, like many others, about the state of media preservation. Everything is hypercentralized now, and with Disney+ arriving soon it seems that our future as artists is even less certain. Disney owns everything, and when it all gets pulled from Netflix, what will happen? Apple seems to want to introduce a subscription-based games service too. If that's successful, it could sweep through games like a tidal wave. We might see the end of individual ownership in media entirely, with a couple mega-corporations at the top leasing it all out to us in limited runs in perpetuity. It's techno-feudalism, I guess.

I've been thinking a lot about what this future means for my own work, and I think I have an answer. The only way to exist outside of techno-feudalism is to exile oneself from platforms entirely and try to build a community on a website of one's own making. This site would necessarily contain all information about my games, methods for purchasing them, a blog, and a forum in which to host my community. This cabin-in-the-woods approach is kind of risky in that I could remain invisible no matter how much I try to build the space, but I feel that the risk is the same as if I were to try to fight for scraps on megaplatforms.

I have examples of developers that have cultivated their own spaces on websites of their own design, such as the folks over at Dwarf Fortress, so I know this can be done successfully.

So I'm going to try. For my own peace of mind, I'm going to try.
