Hello. I probably don't know your name. If I did, I would use it to give a little context here. I don't know who you are. I don't know what kind of person you're like. For all I know, you could be someone I'd really get along with. Maybe we made eye contact on the train. Maybe we happened to randomly get matched up for a round of Millenial Pseudo-Pool at some dive in Chicago. Maybe you rang me up at Trader Joes, when I was committing my routine act of buying some sort of lunch wrap. You commented on that lunch wrap not because you'd ever had it yourself, but because as an employee of Trader Joes you were coerced to. I get that it's your job, friend, but you really don't have to comment on my choice. It's okay, It's not like I'm going to tell your boss that you didn't, and it's probably for the best that I'm not made to confront what the heck I'm ingesting today.

Today? I mindlessly--always mindlessly, never mindfully, story of my hum-drum life--trotted down the stairs of my office building after working eight hours on an inconsequential profit extractor and thought about Tim. I read his writing throughout my breaks and it got me wanting to write something about myself. Something, anything, for myself to refer to so I could piece together what's become of me in the past year. As I exited the building and scrunched up to defend myself from the first frigid week's wind in Chicago I thought I wanted to write about making eye contact with strangers. I cross-referenced, and thought a bit about how I used to struggle to make eye contact with the closest people to me. Why is it that, when I'm alone, I'm always reaching out, and when I'm with someone, I'm always closing up? Every inhalation in this dull winter made my nose dry up. Funny thing about Jack Frost is that he never just nips. Today he was shooting himself way up in my sinuses, through my brain, and out the exit wound in the back.
