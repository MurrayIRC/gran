Hello classmates! I hope this house is melting slowly into a home for all of us. I've updated the site's design today, and added some sort of a customized logo. I much prefer this over just displaying text. I have a copy of the illustration software Affinity Designer installed on my hard disk, and I decided this morning to throw together something nice. 

I used an italicized, medium-weight Futura typeface to spell the word "gran", and noticed that there was a lovely little space beneath the last three letters, under which i could place a fat, black line to bring some balance to the lower part of the "g". It's simple, which I like. I like designs that accomplish the maximum stylistic effect with the purest sense of economy. I'm no designer by profession, but I have to say that I like the appearance of this website now much more than I did yesterday. I am the person who is most likely to spend the most time on here out of anyone, simply by the fact that I am doing this all alone.

Anyways, it's time to go home. I am going to go rock climbing and study my knowledge of Hiragana and Katakana. I cannot wait.
