<p class="meta">8 Aug 2019 - Osaka</p>

My birthday is in ten days. At this point in my life, at the age of twenty-three, I feel a diminished sense of importance towards that day. On the day of my birthday this year, I will be in Japan, away from my family and most of my friends. It will just be me and my girlfriend here. We might go out and get ramen, though I imagine nothing else special will be done. Years ago I remember all my birthdays being planned for me. I loved the surprise of finding out what I would be doing on the day of. Now that I'm an adult, and now that I'm suffering the deepest slump of my life on earth, it is impossible for me to consider making any plans for my birthday.

I want to write but I think I'm terrible at it.

I found out I have BPD.

I want to go home.

I want to die.
